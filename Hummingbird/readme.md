Hummingbird Lite
================

[Web site and documentation](http://vecode.net/hummingbird-lite/)

Lightweight, extensible web framework.

**Current version:** 2.0.6 (Febraury 09, 2016)

### Requirements ###

 - PHP 5.x
 - Apache 2.x with mod_rewrite enabled OR IIS 7+ with Rewrite module installed and enabled

*Note: Some plugins may have additional requirements*

### Installation ###

Just unzip the distribution package and you're done.

### Configuration ###

To configure your hummingbird instance just edit the `config.inc.php` file inside the `/include` folder by setting the appropiate parameters on the `$settings` array. There are three major sections by default:

 - *development* - Set development-specific options here (most likely local host/db).
 - *production* - Set production-specific options here, e.g. the real thing.
 - *shared* - Set global options here.

First make sure to set the correct url under the `site_url` key for the routing engine to work.

Next, choose your database driver and fill the required parameters.

Finally, set your site's name and generate the random salt values under the `shared` section.

Aditionally you may activate any extra plugins by adding them to the `plugins` key, just add its slug.

### Troubleshooting ###

#### 404 errors ####
Sometimes the routing engine will not work out of the box even if you set `site_url`, so you must also set the `RewriteBase` directive on the .htaccess file.

#### 301 redirections ####
Pay special attention to the `site_url` parameter: the default .htaccess strips www. from the URLs and this causes a 301 redirect. You may disable this by editing the .htaccess file.
